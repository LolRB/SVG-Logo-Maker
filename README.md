# Logo Generator

## Description

As a freelance web developer, I wanted a quick and easy way to generate simple logos for my projects without the need to hire a graphic designer. This command-line application allows users to create a custom logo by specifying the text, text color, shape, and shape color. The result is an SVG file that can be used directly in your projects.
